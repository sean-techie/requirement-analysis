# requirement-analysis
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

# Requirement analysis importance in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

-Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.

-Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.

-Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.

-Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.

-Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
• Requirement Gathering 
Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

• Requirement Elicitation 
Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

• Requirement Documentation 
Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective.
Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

• Requirement Analysis and Modeling 
Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

• Requirement Validation 
Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

# Types of Requirements

# Functional Requirements
-This describes what the system should do.

# Examples(for the booking system): 
-User authentication

-Property search

-Booking system

-User registration
 
# Non-funtional Requirements
-This describes how the system should perform. 

# Examples(for the booking system):
-Performance

-Security

-Scalability

-Usability

-Reliability

# Use Case Diagrams

-Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).

# Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:

Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.

# Acceptance Criteria

-What is Acceptance Criteria?
Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

Acceptance Criteria (AC) are a critical component of Requirement Analysis because they clearly define the conditions a product or feature must meet for it to be considered complete and acceptable to the end-user or stakeholders. They bridge the gap between requirements and implementation by ensuring everyone shares the same understanding of what “done” looks like.

Importance of Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria ensure a shared understanding of what a feature must deliver. They make requirements clear, testable, and measurable, helping developers build the right solution and testers validate it. They reduce ambiguity, prevent scope creep, and improve product quality.

# Example: Checkout Feature – Acceptance Criteria

User Story:
As a user, I want to checkout so I can confirm and pay for my booking.

Acceptance Criteria:

A summary of the booking must be displayed at checkout.

User must provide required personal details before payment.

At least one secure payment option must be available.

System must show errors if required fields are missing or payment fails.

After successful payment, a confirmation number and email must be sent to the user.
